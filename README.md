## INSTRUCTION
###### My code is made up of different classes that draws and do different things. I used polymorphism to connect most of the classes that may be a game object. There's the basic functions like the setup and draw and for the classes they all had  a constructor, an update function and render. 

## Features I'm proud of
###### For my project, I really liked the idea of the screen as my eye sight (inside the helmet) and when I move my mouse it's as if its calculating my turn by having a longitude and latitude meter that moves up and down depending where my cursor which works like the eye and also the aim. Even though it was really easy to import sound it just made the program a lot better which triggers other senses and not just the eye.
